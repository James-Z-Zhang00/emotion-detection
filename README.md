# Repository for final project

By completing this project, you have:

Created an Emotion Detection application using the functions from embeddable AI libraries

Extracted relevant information from the output received from the function

Tested and packaged the application created using the Emotion Detection function

Completed web deployment of your application using Flask

Incorporated error handling in your application to account for invalid input to your application

Written codes that are in perfect compliance with PEP8 guidelines, getting 10/10 score in static code analysis

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 

Watson AI libraries are embeddable libraries that are preinstalled in the Cloud IDE framework. These embeddable AI libraries provide a variety of NLP and speech-based functions based on popular AI models.

In the projects, you developed web apps with incorporated AI functionality using IBM Watson libraries. 

Both projects followed the same application creation steps including:

Create a function for the application

Package the application function

Run unit testing of the function by calling it as a package

Deploy the application over the web using Flask

Incorporate Error handling to the application

Run static code analysis on the codes created
